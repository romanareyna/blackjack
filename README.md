# blackjack

Functions to be added to the game logic:
- dealer and player get same scores (now dealer wins in this case);
- ace gives 1 point or 10 points (now it's 10);
- if a dealer gets 5 cards he wins (now it depends on scores);
- if player dealt with blackjack, he wins (right now he just gets 21 points);
